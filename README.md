# Day-013-SR_flipflop
SR flip-flop is a gated set-reset flip-flop. The S and R inputs control the state of the flip-flop when the clock pulse goes from LOW to HIGH. The flip-flop will not change until the clock pulse is on a rising edge. When both S and R are simultaneously HIGH, it is uncertain whether the outputs will be HIGH or LOW.
